Workflow
========

Add the dependency to your pom the GWT inherits will get automatically added by the maven-vaadin-plugin.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.vaadin.addons</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-sliderpanel</artifactId>
    <version>${vaadin-sliderpanel-version}</version>
</dependency>
```

```xml
<inherits name="org.vaadin.sliderpanel.Widgetset" />
```

You can recolor the panel by changing the css like:

```css
.v-sliderpanel-wrapper .v-sliderpanel-content {
  background: #99CCFF;
  color: #000;
}
.v-sliderpanel-wrapper .v-sliderpanel-tab {
  background: #B1E7FF;
  color: #000;
}
```

Version 1.1.x introduced some extra colors that you can use for example:

```java
SliderPanel sliderPanel = new SliderPanel(dummyContent("White Slider", 3), false, SliderMode.TOP);
firstTopSlider.setCaption("White Slider");
firstTopSlider.addStyleName(SliderPanelStyles.COLOR_WHITE);
```

The class **SliderPanelStyles** holds the style options. Further more you can place your custom StyleName in the same way...

Version 1.2.x introduced a fluent builder to configure SliderPanel:

```java
SliderPanel sliderPanel = new SliderPanelBuilder(dummyContent("White Slider", 3))
  .caption("White Slider")
  .mode(SliderMode.TOP)
  .tabPosition(SliderTabPosition.MIDDLE)
  .style(SliderPanelStyles.COLOR_WHITE)
  .build();
```


Details to the addon you can find on [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/directory#addon/sliderpanel)

Layouting
========
![layout-mockup](assets/sliderpanel-layouting.png)
It's important that you take care for the main layout. Use a combination of VerticalLayout and HorizontalLayout. The SliderPosition is only a hint for the component in which direction the slider should get expand. When you place for example as first component a SliderPanel with SliderMode.RIGHT to a HorizontalLayout and afterwards the middleContent with ExpandRatio(1) it will expand outside the visible browserarea.

```java
protected void init(final VaadinRequest vaadinRequest) {
	final HorizontalLayout mainLayout = new HorizontalLayout();
	mainLayout.setSizeFull();
	
	SliderPanel rightSlider = new SliderPanel(new Label("<h2>SliderContent</h2>", ContentMode.HTML), SliderMode.RIGHT);
	rightSlider.setCaption("SliderCaption");
	mainLayout.addComponent(rightSlider);
	
	VerticalLayout middleContent = new VerticalLayout();
	middleContent.setSizeFull();
	middleContent.addComponent(new Label("<h1>MiddleContent</h1><p>Lots of Content ...</p>", ContentMode.HTML));
	
	mainLayout.addComponent(middleContent);
	mainLayout.setExpandRatio(middleContent, 1);
	setContent(mainLayout);
}
```

The Layouting of the SliderPanel is not made absolute because of the possibility to use it also within the layout:
